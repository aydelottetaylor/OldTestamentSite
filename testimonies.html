                        <p>My testimony is that from reading the Old Testament is that God is aware of what people need more than we could ever guess at the time. During the Old Testament, God changed his rules on inbreeding as it would become more harmful due to the increase in genetic mutations that would ocurr as the population grew. I know that he knows what is best for us and that he is aware of the situation. This is evident in the fact we would never learn about this until way later. As changes happen, and we try to follow God we can remember this and we will be blessed as we trust in his wisdom.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Taylor's Testimony</h2>
                        <p>My testimony was strengthened because I was able to learn about God and see that He really does have a plan for each of us and His timing is perfect. A lot of times God asks us to do things that are hard and that go against our nature and how society acts as a whole. You may even think that the things that God commands you or has commanded others in the past to do are weird or don’t make any sense, but God knows better than all of us and He will make his ways known to us when it is time. God also has a perfect timeline, He knows exactly what to command his people to do and when He needs to command them to do it and to stop doing it and that way his people are able to thrive when they follow what He tells them to do.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Josh's Testimony</h2>
                        <p>Something that was meaningful to me and strengthened my testimony of the Old Testament was just learning about the nature of God. I learned that God has reasons for things and He has a timeline for things. I love science and love learning how the world works, so it was special to me to learn that He created biology and follows truth and principles. It’s not just complete randomness and him forcing his children to do random things for no reason. That was impactful to me because I never thought about the literally biology and science behind these kinds of “weird” stories in the bible.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Phillip's Testimony</h2>
                        <p>Humanity is difficult to predict, God is difficult to know and predict, but throughout the course of this project, I have gained greater respect for God and how He has managed to lead His people through each dispensation. Just trying to simulate a population is hard enough, much less influence and guide it. God is more than just some amorphous, ethereal, universal power. He loves us. He loves us more than we could possibly imagine. He knows us. He wants us to be happy, and he’s willing to help each and every person through every one of their difficulties, and as a mortal human, I can’t even begin to comprehend how He can do that. I know this church is true, and I know I don’t have all the answers, but I know that they are out there, waiting to be revealed at a later time, or in the next life.</p>
